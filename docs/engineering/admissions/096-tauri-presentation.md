# Spec 096 dependency admission — presentation preview

**Operation:** locked normal `DEPENDENCY`; no upstream implementation copied into the repository.

**Placement:** isolated `apps/desktop-tauri` presentation workspace; no Core, canonical store, key or network authority.
**Qualification:** preparatory synthetic-only build, not release admission.

Tauri Rust 2.12.0 / build 2.7.0 from `https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri` use the Apache-2.0 OR MIT license choice. The app selects only Wry, compression, Windows controls and X11 features. API/CLI npm 2.12.0 are from the same official project. The React/React DOM 19.3.0 runtime is MIT; TypeScript 7.0.2 is Apache-2.0; Vite 8.3.1 and Tailwind 4.3.3 are MIT build tools. All resolved package identities/integrities are in the two committed lockfiles. The root Core workspace and its lockfile are untouched.

## Exact MPL source obligations

These unmodified transitive CSS/platform libraries are admitted by exact-version license exceptions, without adding MPL to the global allow list. MPL source remains separately licensed. No MedScale file is derived from a modified MPL source file. Any preview binary artifact must include the original `.crate` source archives, their original notices, a full MPL text and a notice identifying the sources. The packaging script verifies the archive SHA-256 against the locked identity before inclusion.

Canonical registry source URL for each row is `https://static.crates.io/crates/NAME/NAME-VERSION.crate`. Original headers and license files remain in those archives. The preview also carries the existing Inter and JetBrains Mono NL OFL notices and the first-party project NOTICE. Lightning CSS 1.32.0/1.33.0 is unmodified MPL build tooling in the npm lock, absent from the shipped JS bundle; a redistribution of that tool itself requires its original source/notices separately.

## Security and lifecycle

Npm installation disables all lifecycle scripts. The direct and complete npm lock inventories were checked with NPMScan; the actual lock paths were independently checked after a duplicate-version source-mapping warning. See 096 research for limits. Rust cargo-deny is run against this final graph; `glib` 0.18.5 / RUSTSEC-2024-0429 remains an open Linux security finding and is not ignored. License admission does not resolve it. Tauri grants only the one shell-status command to the main local window and no privileged plugin permissions.

Updates require a forward lockfile change, advisory/license/script review, narrow capability review and native evidence at the changed head. The exit strategy is to remove this isolated preview and retain Slint until migration parity; a Tauri upstream upgrade must not change Core semantics or the PHI boundary. No source-policy or release claim is made from dependency resolution alone.

//! Spec 076 collaboration substrate commands (CLI vertical slice through Core).
//!
//! Every command opens the session scope, dispatches one typed Core request
//! via `CliSession`, and renders the typed result as human lines or stable
//! JSON. The CLI never writes collaboration storage directly.
//!
//! Anchor input is deliberately simplified here to `IdentityOnly` bindings
//! (`--artifact-id` + `--artifact-kind`): a CLI operator surface does not
//! need every `ArtifactVersionBinding` precision Core supports internally.
//! This is a CLI scope simplification, not a Core limitation.

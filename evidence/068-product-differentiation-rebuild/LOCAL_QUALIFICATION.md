# Spec 068 Local Qualification

**State**: PASS_FOR_REVIEW
**Base**: `44f8f2eabfa680bfff21851273406e194e0bd862`
**Branch**: `spec/068-product-differentiation-rebuild`

## Product and design evidence

- Native Home, Models, and Evidence surfaces were rendered and manually reviewed.
- Rendered evidence is stored under `evidence/068-product-differentiation-rebuild/rendered/` with SHA-256 digests recorded in `RENDERED_DESIGN_REVIEW.md`.
- Impeccable `4.1.0` was used as a design-review discipline; its detector returned no findings for the Slint source, but that is not treated as full Slint coverage.
- Abridge was studied as product/typography evidence only. No Abridge font or proprietary brand asset was copied.
- Geist and Geist Mono were installed on the development Mac for rendered review; the release package does not yet claim bundled Geist assets.
## Regression and build evidence

- `cargo test -p medscale-core --test native_desktop_ui_060`: 3/3 PASS.

- `cargo test -p medscale-core --test product_differentiation_068`: 5/5 PASS.
- `cargo test -p medscale-desktop`: 15/15 unit PASS plus 3/3 runtime-perf regression PASS.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`: PASS.
- Rust `1.88.0` workspace/all-target check: PASS.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: PASS.
- `git -c core.whitespace=cr-at-eol diff --check`: PASS.

The historical Spec 060 and Spec 066 regression contracts were updated only where they encoded superseded palette/copy literals. Their native-shell, mobile-deferral, review-before-action, CI, and engineering-contrast intent remains enforced.

# T077-03 Implementation — AgentIdentity + AgentCapabilityManifest

## Scope

Vertical slice: register/get/list/revoke for `AgentIdentity` +
`AgentCapabilityManifest`, through Core authority exactly (contracts ->
envelopes -> facade -> CLI), mirroring the `pg`/`ds`/`collab` pattern this
codebase already established in Specs 074/075/076.

## Design decision: `pack_version` is Core-derived, never caller-supplied

`RequestBody::AgentIdentityRegister` carries only `pack_id`, not
`pack_version`. `MedAgent::register_agent_identity` resolves the
currently admitted `PackManifestV0` for that `pack_id` via
`PackStore::get(&pack_id)` and captures its real `.version` field onto the
new `AgentIdentity`. A `pack_id` the local `PackStore` does not recognize
(never admitted, or since-removed) returns `AuthorityError::InvalidArgument`
before any row is written -- fail-closed per `security.md` T5. This closes
an otherwise-open spoofing vector where a caller could otherwise claim an
arbitrary `pack_version` string unrelated to what is actually admitted.
Recorded in `contracts.md`'s `AgentIdentity` section.

## Tests

`crates/medscale-core/tests/medagent_077.rs`, using a single-actor
`CoreFacade` harness (trimmed from `collaboration_076.rs`'s multi-actor
one, since agent-identity lifecycle is scope-level, not
membership-gated) and the real Spec 008 fixture pack
(`evidence/008-local-ai-capability-fabric/fixtures/pack-fixture-ner-v0`):

1. `register_get_list_revoke_roundtrip_through_core` -- full lifecycle
   through real `CoreFacade::dispatch`: register (asserts `pack_version`
   was captured, non-empty, and matches the admitted pack), get, list,
   revoke, then a second revoke attempt with the now-stale
   `expected_revision` fails closed with `Conflict`.
2. `registration_against_non_admitted_pack_fails_closed` -- registers
   against a `pack_id` that was never installed; asserts
   `AuthorityError::InvalidArgument`, proving `security.md` T5's fail-closed
   requirement end-to-end through the facade, not just at the storage
   layer.
3. `capability_manifest_is_immutable_and_registration_is_scoped_to_its_project` --
   two identities in two different Projects (same admitted pack) get
   distinct ids and independent capability manifests; the first identity's
   manifest is unaffected by the second registration's wider grant set.
4. `agent_identity_survives_vault_reopen` -- registers an identity, drops
   the `Harness` (closing the in-process facade), opens a brand new
   `CoreFacade` against the same on-disk synthetic vault root, and reads
   the identity back with an identical `pack_version`/`revision` --
   matching `collaboration_076.rs`'s own reopen-durability precedent.

No local compile/test run was possible on this workstation (MSVC linker
absent, the same constraint every prior spec in this repository has
recorded); `cargo fmt --check` is clean across the whole workspace after
this change. Real qualification is the next exact-head CI run.

# Whole-product review evidence record

Review date: 2026-09-09. Target: TheHalfMoon/MedScale (not TheHalfMoon/MESC).
Source baseline: `b49592c83d23542363f671afe6a9ae65fc65b276`.
Tree: `8b79737e6f0b320308b95b30e22e5fd94c08b7df`.

## Observations and limits

Individual authenticated GitHub reads observed main as the sole branch, zero open PRs,
PRs 1–33 merged, no tags/releases, no rulesets, and unprotected main (branch protection
endpoint returned 404). Main CI run 32940232817 succeeded. These are time-bound observations,
not repository settings changes or proof of a complete historical review-thread audit.
All review threads and historical comments were not exhaustively retrieved.

A later consolidated GitHub snapshot command was rejected by automatic approval review
because of an account usage limit. It did not run and no consolidated snapshot was saved.
Earlier individual reads succeeded. Do not cite a nonexistent raw snapshot.

Local baseline `cargo test --workspace --locked --offline` completed successfully: 98 tests
across 38 suites. This proves the scoped baseline test suite passes, not production privacy,
real IPC, real OS sandboxing, clinical safety, mobile readiness or comparative superiority.
Patch validation: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `git diff --check` passed. Relative
Markdown file-link validation passed for all 17 changed documents. Source path/line validation
identified and corrected one abbreviated effects-module reference. Independent review found
and resolved the Q02/Q04 lock dependency cycle and Q10's unnecessary worker dependency.
Remote head/CI and merge status must be verified separately at delivery; baseline CI is not
evidence for this patch. Runtime code and dependency manifests are unchanged.

## Review coverage

Read canonical instructions, constitution, build queue, master plans, decision defaults,
definition of done, external gates, source acquisition and UI integration contract. Inspected
representative implementations of core facade/store, CLI session, object/time contracts,
FHIR parsing, vault/key/blob/SQLite paths, presentation/retrieval, Pack runtime/store,
broker transport, action transitions, MESC admission, desktop/mobile stubs and CI.
An independent read-only architecture reviewer corroborated trust-boundary observations.
This was source-backed architecture review, not exhaustive line-by-line vulnerability auditing.

No real PHI, production integrations, model execution, donor installation, clinical benchmark,
OS sandbox experiment, device qualification or malicious-input exploitation was performed.
Historical source inventory was not exhaustively requalified. Donor scope and citations are in
[source review](../../docs/planning/source-register/2026-09-09-source-review.md).

## Deliverables

- [Whole-product review](../../docs/planning/WHOLE_PRODUCT_REVIEW_2026-09-09.md)
- [Trust and privacy model](../../docs/security/TRUST_AND_PRIVACY_MODEL.md)
- [Prioritized delivery plan](../../docs/planning/TRUSTED_V1_DELIVERY_PLAN.md)
- [MESC acceptance contract](../../docs/planning/MESC_ARTIFACT_ACCEPTANCE.md)
- [Bounded follow-on package](../../specs/review-trusted-v1-2026-09-09/README.md)

Release readiness: FALSE. OpenMed superiority: NOT_MEASURED. MESC gate: BLOCKED.
Planning readiness and runtime qualification are separate axes.

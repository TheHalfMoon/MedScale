# Exact-Range Scope Record — Spec 084

A deterministic scope record under
`docs/planning/FOUNDER_REVIEW_POLICY_AMENDMENT_2026-09-22.md`. Not a semantic
review; no external reviewer ran or is required. The deterministic security
challenge is in `SECURITY.md`.

| Check | Command (bash) | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Files outside authorized scope | `git diff --name-only $B $H` filtered to `crates/medscale-(contracts\|storage\|core\|cli\|keys)/`, `docs/planning/(BUILD_QUEUE\|SPEC_084_PROMOTION).md`, `evidence/084-hub/`, `specs/084-hub/` | none outside |
| Network crate | `git diff --name-only $B $H -- crates/medscale-network` | unchanged |
| Dependency / CI / toolchain manifests | `git diff --name-only $B $H -- '*Cargo.toml' Cargo.lock deny.toml supply-chain .github rust-toolchain.toml scripts` | none changed; no new dependency |
| Network or process APIs in 084 modules | `grep -nE "TcpStream\|TcpListener\|UdpSocket\|ureq\|reqwest\|hyper::\|medscale_network\|std::process::Command\|std::net"` over the six 084 source files | none |
| CLI reaching storage, SQLite or keys | `grep -nE "medscale_storage\|rusqlite\|medscale_keys"` over `medscale-cli/src/hub.rs` | none |
| `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`unreachable!` and print calls outside tests (contracts, keys, storage and Core 084 modules) | awk scan before `#[cfg(test)]` | none |
| Added `unsafe` | `git diff $B $H -- 'crates/*.rs' \| grep '^+' \| grep -cE 'unsafe \{\|unsafe fn'` | 0 |
| Whitespace | `git -c core.whitespace=cr-at-eol diff --check $B $H` | clean (`medscale-cli/src/main.rs` is CRLF on main; added lines keep it) |
| Format / dependency direction | `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `scripts/check-dependency-direction.ps1` | clean; passed |
| History | branch started from the Spec 083 branch while 083 closed; forward merges of main (`7858106`); no rebase, no force-push | verified |

The Spec 024 IPC module gains one additive method,
`HostIpcServer::serve_connection_limited`; existing serving is unchanged.

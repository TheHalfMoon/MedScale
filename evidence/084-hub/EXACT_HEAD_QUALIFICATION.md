| Job | Conclusion |
|---|---|
| supply-chain policy present | success |
| cargo-deny | success |
| perf delivery-plan scale (windows) | success |
| rust (ubuntu-latest) | success |
| rust (macos-latest) | success |
| rust (windows-latest) | success |

Each `rust (*)` job runs fmt check, dependency direction, Clippy with
`-D warnings`, the full workspace tests, and portable package qualification.
Counts from the job logs (`test result:` lines summed):

| Job | `test result` lines | passed | failed | ignored | `FAILED`/`panicked` lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rust (ubuntu-latest) | 125 | 854 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| rust (windows-latest) | 125 | 851 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

All 17 named storage, Core, CLI and key tests in `QUALIFICATION.md` appear
with `ok` in both logs, including `restore_rejects_hand_edited_084_snapshots`
(14 cases), `a_hub_served_over_local_ipc_syncs_a_client` and
`hub_commands_run_through_core_over_local_ipc` (real local socket on Linux
and Windows). The macOS job passed; its per-test counts were not extracted.

Commits after the code head change documentation only; the final head
needs its own required CI run before merge, recorded in
`POST_MERGE_VERIFICATION.md` and `CLOSURE.md`.

Earlier heads on this branch (historical only):

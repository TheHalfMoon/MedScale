## What this closure establishes

MedScale has a Core-owned Compute path with a separate MedScale-owned
worker process:
- Core admits a typed job from a closed set of kinds, pins one exact Spec
  075 snapshot by its content digest, and records the job with a manifest
  digest over input, runtime identity, execution policy and ceilings.
  Refusals are terminal `denied` jobs with receipts.
- A job runs at most once. A run re-reads and re-digests the stored bytes,
  then pipes them to `medscale-compute-worker`, which starts with a
  cleared environment, an empty private working directory and stdio pipes
  only, and applies its OS mechanism to itself before computing.
- Core bounds stdout and stderr, enforces the timeout and cancellation,
  and treats the answer as a candidate: job binding, digest, canonical
  encoding and shape are checked before the terminal state, receipt and
  output are committed in one transaction.
- Eleven distinct states are kept apart; stderr text is never stored; a
  job left `running` by a crash is recovered as `interrupted` and never
  re-run.
- Outputs are derived and `unreviewed`; nothing writes a source snapshot.

## Defects found and fixed during qualification

- The contract test found `{"kind":"column_profile","code":"x"}` parsing:
  serde ignores unknown fields on unit variants of internally tagged
  enums. `ColumnProfile {}` is now an empty struct variant (`3bd00d1`).
- A scripted edit had rewritten `medscale-cli/src/main.rs` from CRLF to LF;
  found by the scope record's diff statistics and restored (`e26a773`).
- CI found three Clippy/compile defects in new code and tests, fixed
  forward (see `EXACT_RANGE_REVIEW.md`).

## Honest residuals (non-blocking, recorded)

- The worker's OS mechanism is `ReadyBaseMeasured` only; this is defense
  in depth for MedScale's own code, not a sandbox for untrusted code.
- No OS memory or CPU quota; the process-count limit is OS-enforced on
  Windows only; the Windows mechanism has no network axis (the worker has
  no network code).
- Inherited-handle hygiene relies on the Rust standard library; no OS
  handle allowlist.
- Cancelling a running job needs the in-process handle; the CLI runs jobs
  synchronously.
- The worker binary is not in the portable release package; Compute there
  reports `unavailable`.
- No remote or self-hosted worker, GPU, scheduler, R or Python (later
  slices; arbitrary code waits for platform qualification).
- No Desktop surface; no rendered Desktop evidence.
- No local compile or test run completed on this workstation; GitHub
  Actions is the compiler of record.

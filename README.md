MedScale is a local-first clinical intelligence platform. A Rust Core owns every source, assertion, provenance record and authority decision. The desktop and command-line surfaces only present and request through it.

- **Local by default.** Records, vaults and models stay on the device. Network egress is denied unless an explicit, governed action allows it.
- **Evidence you can inspect.** Every statement links back to its source, its coverage and its review state. Unknown, conflicting and unsupported data are shown as such, never filled in.
- **Encrypted workspaces.** Vaults are SQLCipher-encrypted at rest and sealed on close, with recovery codes.
- **Local models, honestly labelled.** Models run offline through signed MedScale Packs and propose; people decide. Catalog listings are kept separate from downloaded, admitted, tested and qualified models.
- **One Core, several surfaces.** The Tauri desktop, the CLI, and future mobile and SDK bindings share the same Core semantics.

> **Status: engineering preview, synthetic data only.** MedScale is not release-ready, not clinically validated and not a medical device. Real patient data is not authorized. Installers are unsigned engineering builds. See [external gates](docs/planning/EXTERNAL_GATES.md).

Design: [brand identity system](docs/brand/BRAND_IDENTITY_SYSTEM.md) and [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md). Desktop: [`apps/desktop-tauri`](apps/desktop-tauri/README.md). Product program: [productization](docs/planning/PRODUCTIZATION_PROGRAM.md).

## Working on MedScale (engineering and agents)

### Cursor: start here

Open the repository in Cursor and tell it to read [`CURSOR.md`](CURSOR.md) and continue MedScale from live repository truth. The repository contains standing founder authorization and an autonomous build queue; Cursor should not need routine founder decisions.

Read order:

1. [`CURSOR.md`](CURSOR.md)
2. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
3. [`docs/planning/START_HERE.md`](docs/planning/START_HERE.md)
4. [`docs/planning/BUILD_QUEUE.md`](docs/planning/BUILD_QUEUE.md)
5. [`docs/planning/MASTER_BUILD_PLAN_V2.md`](docs/planning/MASTER_BUILD_PLAN_V2.md)

### Active state

```text
PLAN = CANONICAL_V2
SPEC_000 = CLOSED_CANONICAL
CURRENT_EXECUTION_QUEUE = docs/planning/BUILD_QUEUE.md
PRODUCT_MATURITY = SYNTHETIC_FOUNDATION_NOT_RELEASE_READY
CURSOR_AUTONOMOUS_IMPLEMENTATION = AUTHORIZED_WITHIN_PLAN
REAL_PHI = NOT_AUTHORIZED
MESC_MUTATION = NOT_AUTHORIZED
PRODUCT_RUNTIME_EGRESS = DEFAULT_DENY
```

See the [whole-product review](docs/planning/WHOLE_PRODUCT_REVIEW_2026-09-09.md) and
[prioritized delivery plan](docs/planning/TRUSTED_V1_DELIVERY_PLAN.md) for current gaps and
follow-on work. OpenMed superiority has not been measured.

### Engineering bootstrap (historical foundation)

- Contributing: [`docs/engineering/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/engineering/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Dependency direction: [`docs/engineering/DEPENDENCY_DIRECTION.md`](docs/engineering/DEPENDENCY_DIRECTION.md)

## Comparisons and provenance

MedScale measures itself against named external baselines without depending on them. OpenMed is used as a **pinned comparator** (`v2.2.0` frozen in Spec 071; a separate `v3.0.0` snapshot in Spec 103). Any comparative claim needs measured evidence; none of superiority is made here. MESC is a separate scientific project and owns no MedScale clinical truth. Adapted third-party material keeps its license and attribution: see [`third_party/provenance`](third_party/provenance), the generated `NOTICE.md` and SBOM in every release set, and the [source acquisition plan](docs/planning/SOURCE_ACQUISITION_AND_COPY_PLAN.md).

## License

MedScale first-party source is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). Crates remain `publish = false`; the source license decision does not imply release readiness or authorize restricted data, credentials, terminology, model assets, or partner integrations.

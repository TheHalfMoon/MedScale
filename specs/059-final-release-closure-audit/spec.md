# Feature Specification: Final Release Closure Audit (Q05)

**Branch**: `spec/059-final-release-closure-audit`
**Status**: IN_REVIEW
**Promotion**: FRESH_TERMINAL_EXECUTABILITY_AUDIT_2026-09-14
**Does not**: claim `RELEASE_READY`, `PRIVATE_DATA_READY`, WCAG conformance, signed/notarized distribution, qualified-hardware performance, or macOS product qualification.

## User Stories

### US1 Canonical release-state synchronization (P1)
Live release/checklist/signing/planning documents reflect the merged Spec 058 package lifecycle, Apache-2.0 decision, protected-main ruleset, qualified release SBOM, and current external residuals without rewriting historical evidence.

### US2 Material findings clearance (P1)
A bounded final audit proves there are no unresolved repository-owned material findings in the current Trusted V1 release-qualification scope: no open GitHub PR/issue finding, no release-critical TODO/FIXME marker, no stale live release assertion, and no unmapped doctor release residual.

### US3 External-only residual mapping (P1)
Every remaining release doctor evidence class maps to a concrete external gate with an exact input/action required to continue. Optional MESC remains non-blocking.

### US4 Honest terminal project state (P1)
After exact-head qualification and merge, MedScale may report `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_PENDING_EXTERNAL_GATES` while keeping `RELEASE_READY=false`, `PRIVATE_DATA_READY=false`, and all unresolved external claims false.

## Anti-scope
Production credentials; signing/notarization; qualified release hardware procurement; final v0 UI invention; WCAG certification without final UI; real PHI; MESC mutation; advanced 060+ product features.

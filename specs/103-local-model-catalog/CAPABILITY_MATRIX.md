# OpenMed ↔ MedScale model-execution capability matrix (Spec 103, issue #183)

**Baseline:** OpenMed v3.0.0, `maziyarpanahi/openmed@ea920f36fadd7b45935247d639f0ffa1ef493b23`, source-read. Newer upstream changes are not part of this baseline.
**MedScale:** `main` (Spec 103 PRs #184–#200 and Spec 104 PR #198 merged). A row's status changes only with merged code and recorded evidence.
**Evidence base:** real-model qualification on free GitHub runners (Linux x64 CPU, synthetic text):
- ONNX on tract: run [37984399447](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/MedScale/actions/runs/37984399447), on the exact code of #196;
- safetensors on candle: run [37986892863](https://github.com/TheHalfMoon/MedScale/actions/runs/37986892863). Each model's catalog binding, per-file digests, signed Pack and admission were verified before execution.

Status vocabulary:
- **IMPLEMENTED:** merged with tests;
- **IN REVIEW:** implemented in an open PR;
- **PARTIAL:** the gap is stated;
- **NOT IMPLEMENTED:** no MedScale code;
- **BLOCKED:** the named external constraint applies.

## 1. Lifecycle (DISCOVER → INSPECT → ACQUIRE → VERIFY → ADMIT → LOAD → RUN → COMPARE → UNLOAD)

| Stage | OpenMed v3.0.0 (source) | MedScale | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discover / search | `models.jsonl` (2,266 rows), `core/model_registry.py`, `core/model_search.py` | Bounded JSONL import, 10-state status ladder, filters, stable order, pagination (`medscale-pack/src/catalog.rs`). Core capability `ModelCatalogRead` (#193). CLI `packs catalog` | IMPLEMENTED (no tier filter; offset pagination) |
| Inspect before download | model cards, size estimates | Size estimate labelled `estimated`. Pre-download `runtime_expectation` per row from recorded evidence (`compatibility.rs`), including known-defective exports | IMPLEMENTED (expectations are architecture-level) |
| Acquire | `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download`, `core/hf_hub.py`; Android `ModelDownloader.kt` | Per-model consent with a byte ceiling, Governed Browse transport, Hub host allowlist, pinned commit, atomic staging (#187). File-level resume of interrupted acquisitions (#192) | IMPLEMENTED (#187, #192). No byte-range resume. The live CLI acquisition is not exercised on the founder workstation (memory) |
| Verify | `core/model_integrity.py`, pinned revisions | OpenMed reproducibility hash ported; per-file LFS SHA-256 or git-blob SHA-1; exact sizes; gated and private repositories refused (`hf_snapshot.rs`) | IMPLEMENTED |
| Admit | n/a (OpenMed loads directly) | Signed MedScale Pack (synthetic trust root), anti-rollback, provenance, `PacksInstallLocal` | IMPLEMENTED (production signing `NOT_GRANTED`) |
| Load / prepare | `onnx/inference.py` `OnnxModel.from_pretrained`; `core/backends.py` | tract static-shape plan. Normalisations: `Shape`/`Cast→TDim`, integer `Sign`, `If` branches, symbolic `value_info` relaxation, fp16→fp32 widening. Degenerate tokenizers refused (#196) | IMPLEMENTED for 6 architectures (#196) |
| Run | `OnnxModel.predict_batch_detailed` (windows, best-context vote, entity decoding) | Single-window `run`. `run_document`: whole-document windows, best-context vote and BIOES entity decoding, ported from OpenMed (#194) | IMPLEMENTED (#194). No multi-window batching |
| Compare | n/a | Model Fleet lanes over catalog-admitted Packs (#188); factual comparison, never a ranking | IMPLEMENTED |
| Unload / residency | `core/model_cache_policy.py`, `ModelLoader.unload_model`, `onnx/ram_budget.py` | `ResidencyPool`: budgeted LRU, pinning, plan-before-evict (#185); Core prepared-model cache on it (2 GiB) | IMPLEMENTED (no RSS probe; budget by artifact size) |

## 2. Runtimes and platforms

| Runtime / platform | OpenMed v3.0.0 | MedScale | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| ONNX on CPU | ONNX Runtime `CPUExecutionProvider`; fp32 / int8 variants; threads | tract 0.22.4 (pure Rust, no native runtime download). fp32 and fp16 (widened) | IMPLEMENTED. int8 exports not prepared (quantized operators) |
| ONNX Runtime (native) | yes | Evaluated, not admitted: tract covers all six qualified architectures. ORT adds a native binary to the supply chain; it would mainly help DeBERTa prepare time and int8 | NOT IMPLEMENTED by decision. Revisit if int8 or prepare time becomes a product requirement |
| PyTorch / Transformers weights | `HuggingFaceBackend` (Python) | **Native safetensors runtime on `candle` 0.9.1** (Spec 104): no Python, no pickle, no executable code. Encoders from `candle-transformers`, MedScale-built heads, same windowing and decoding | IMPLEMENTED (#198). 5 architectures executed on CI; scores match the ONNX runs to about four decimals. Pickle-only weights are refused |
| Apple MLX | `openmed/mlx/*` (bert, deberta-v2, modernbert, longformer, gliner heads) | — | NOT IMPLEMENTED. Needs a dependency-admission spec plus Apple Silicon qualification (macOS CI runners are arm64) |
| Core ML | export only (`coreml` extra) | — | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| OpenVINO / TensorRT / GGUF | exporters and sessions | — | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| Android | `android/openmedkit` (ORT Mobile, accelerator fallback, model cache/downloader) | No Android surface | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| Browser / WebGPU | `js/openmedkit-web` (ORT Web, WebGPU session) | No browser runtime; the Tauri desktop is blocked (F096-T01) | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| Backend auto-selection | `get_backend`: MLX → HF → ONNX by availability | A single backend. Pre-download expectations replace availability probing | PARTIAL |
| Offline mode | `core/offline.py` (`local_files_only`, socket blocking) | Default-deny egress everywhere. The runtime has no network code; acquisition is the only egress and needs consent | IMPLEMENTED (stricter by default) |

## 3. Architectures (ONNX token classification, measured)

| Architecture | Catalog rows | Model qualified (commit) | Prepare / warm run (CI) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bert | 754 | DiseaseDetect-ElectraMed-33M (`54c9cc11`) | 0.9 s / 0.36 s | EXECUTED_TESTED |
| distilbert | 204 | AnatomyDetect-TinyMed-65M (`ad5e79cb`) | 0.8 s / 0.17 s | EXECUTED_TESTED |
| roberta | 209 | AnatomyDetect-TinyMed-82M (`95f0bf74`) | 1.8 s / 0.17 s | EXECUTED_TESTED |
| modernbert | 227 | AnatomyDetect-ModernClinical-149M (`66525717`) | 3.6 s / 0.9 s | EXECUTED_TESTED |
| deberta-v2 | 304 | PII-Dutch-SuperClinical-Small-44M (`e41c8009`) | 769 s / 0.41 s | EXECUTED_TESTED on CI (#196). First prepare is not interactive on tract; the candle path prepares the same model in 2.8 s |
| xlm-roberta | 366 | PII-Spanish-BigMed-Large-278M fp16 (`da3fec60`) | 4.6 s / 0.6 s | EXECUTED_TESTED on CI (#196). The **65 XLM-R NER exports ship a degenerate tokenizer** (BPE, 0 merges) and are refused |
| gliner, eurobert, qwen, others | 91, 33, 30, … | — | — | NOT IMPLEMENTED (span heads, generative and vision models need different runtimes) |

### Safetensors path (Spec 104, candle; PyTorch-format rows)

| model_type | Model qualified (commit) | Prepare / warm run (CI) |
|---|---|---|
| bert | NER-AnatomyDetect-ElectraMed-33M (`3c914174`) | 0.45 s / 22 ms |
| distilbert | NER-AnatomyDetect-TinyMed-65M (`1ab9359d`) | 0.80 s / 43 ms |
| roberta | NER-AnatomyDetect-TinyMed-82M (`724a3702`) | 0.86 s / 39 ms |
| deberta-v2 | PII-Dutch-SuperClinical-Small-44M (`ee9cafad`) | 2.80 s / 122 ms |
| modernbert | NER-AnatomyDetect-ModernClinical-149M (`3c0bdcc3`) | 1.89 s / 68 ms |

PyTorch-format XLM-R (1.11 GB) exceeds the 1 GiB Pack bound and is refused.

### Pre-download expectations across the catalog (2,266 rows)

These are architecture-level **expectations**, not tests:

| Expectation | Rows |
|---|---|
| Expected runnable via ONNX on tract | 646 |
| Expected runnable via safetensors on candle | 582 |
| Known blocked: XLM-R NER defective tokenizer | 65 |
| Known blocked: PyTorch-format XLM-R over the 1 GiB bound | 122 |
| Known blocked: GLiNER, pickle-only weights (`pytorch_model.bin`) | 91 |
| MLX-only repositories (no MLX runtime in MedScale) | 658 |
| Other (untested architectures, generative, vision) | 102 |

**Correction (2026-10-10).** An earlier revision of this table, merged in #199, counted 1,109 safetensors candidates and 244 XLM-R rows over the bound. OpenMed lists its `*-mlx` repositories with formats `["mlx-fp", "pytorch"]`, but those repositories publish MLX weights only. They are now counted as MLX-only, here and in the runtime expectation (#198).

"Catalog rows" are listing counts. Only the named models are `EXECUTED_TESTED`. No row is `TASK_QUALIFIED` (no labelled evaluation) or `CLINICALLY_VALIDATED`.

## 4. Task families

| Task | OpenMed v3.0.0 | MedScale | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| NER (token classification) | `ner/*`, ONNX/HF/MLX pipelines | Runtime above; evidence-only proposals | IMPLEMENTED |
| PII token classification | PII models plus `core/pii.py`, entity merger, validators, anonymizer | The PII models run as token classifiers (DeBERTa and XLM-R evidence). OpenMed's merger, validators and anonymizer are not ported; MedScale's privacy gate (Specs 079–082) is separate | PARTIAL |
| Zero-shot (GLiNER) | `ner/families/gliner*.py`, `mlx/models/gliner_*` | — | NOT IMPLEMENTED. Also BLOCKED: the 91 rows ship pickle only |
| Multimodal | `openmed/multimodal/*` | — | NOT IMPLEMENTED |

## 5. External constraints (precise)

- **F096-T01:** the Tauri dependency advisory (`glib`, Linux). The founder has **not** accepted it. It blocks the Tauri chain (#174 → #179) and therefore the Models UI (T103-07).
- **The OpenMed XLM-R NER exports** need upstream republishing of their tokenizers.
- **PyTorch-format XLM-R (122 rows)** exceeds the 1 GiB Pack bound. Raising the bound is a governed decision; it has not been taken.
- **GLiNER zero-shot (91 rows)** ships pickle weights only, which are refused (R103-06). It needs upstream safetensors.
- **Production signing** is `NOT_GRANTED`; **real PHI** is `NOT_AUTHORIZED`; **clinical validation** is `NOT_PERFORMED`.
- **Training-dataset terms** (BC5CDR, ANATOMY, PII sets) are unverified ([rights ledger](../../evidence/103-local-model-catalog/RIGHTS_LEDGER.md)).

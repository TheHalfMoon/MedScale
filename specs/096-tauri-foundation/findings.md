# Open findings — Spec 096

| ID | Finding | State / owner |
|---|---|---|
| F096-T01 | `glib` 0.18.5 remains in the Tauri 2.12 Linux graph and is affected by RUSTSEC-2024-0429 / GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g (`VariantStrIter` unsoundness; upstream fix requires >=0.20). The GTK3 stack does not resolve that version directly. | OPEN. Do not ignore the advisory or call Linux security qualification PASS. Investigate a bounded upstream backport or supported graph before shipping. |
| F096-T02 | Unmodified MPL-2.0 `cssparser` 0.37.0, `cssparser-macros` 0.7.1, `dtoa-short` 0.3.5, `option-ext` 0.2.0 and `selectors` 0.38.0 require source availability and notices. | Exact-version admission recorded; cargo-deny licenses passed. All three native packaging jobs passed at 76e9fe3. Windows package verification checked 1,027 file sizes/digests with zero mismatches, including five original source archives and complete MPL text. Rebind receipts at the final head; global license allow list unchanged. |
| F096-T03 | The only native IPC command reported shell/Core availability; actual Core Host/session/authorization DTO integration was absent. | ADDRESSED IN PR #177 (unmerged): Rust owns an in-process Core `CliSession`; 67 narrow named commands are validated in Rust and authorized by Core; the WebView holds no vault key, passphrase or Core handle. Synthetic-only. Closes only when #177 merges with its gates. |
| F096-T04 | Browser source/build does not qualify native visual fidelity or focus/keyboard behavior. | Windows evidence captured and inspected at 76e9fe3: both Home themes/sizes, palette and unavailable Patients; see evidence/096-tauri-foundation/native/76e9fe3. Current-head binding, independent visual review, Figma comparison and macOS/Linux visual acceptance remain OPEN. |
| F096-T05 | WebView incognito/CSP/local assets do not prove privacy containment across cache/crash/log/storage. | OPEN. Synthetic-only; private-data readiness remains false. 2026-10-07: no remote application-originated request observed in the performed measurement; WebView2 runtime background egress and default crash-dump upload recorded (see investigation below). |
| F096-T06 | Required Jev/Alibaba OCR independent provider reviews have no established zero-cost path; 095 is also unmerged. | BLOCKED_BY_ZERO_COST / dependency. Do not merge or claim review PASS. |
| F096-T07 | Canonical CI used checkout's PR merge-ref default. The 342dd28 Ubuntu job actually checked out `03cc7519a58b5cb9e686678caa5aa232645b0dbc`, a generated merge into the remote 095 base. Run metadata alone does not bind the tested tree to the submitted head. | Forward repair sets all canonical checkouts to the PR head (main runs use the event SHA). Exact-head execution still requires verification from fresh job logs and package receipts. Historical CI results remain recorded without being rewritten as head-tree tests. |

### F096-T05 Windows runtime egress investigation (2026-10-07, PR #177 package `5b5643d`)

Method:
- The CI-built Windows package for head `5b5643d` was launched by `scripts/observe-tauri-runtime-egress.ps1` on a separate, never-shown Windows desktop, so it could not receive the user's input.
- The script recorded non-loopback TCP connections per process role for 25 s, then terminated the process tree. No UI interaction occurred.
- Three runs: baseline; `--disable-features=msSmartScreenProtection` through `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS`; and Chromium NetLog (`--log-net-log`, capture mode Default).

| Classification | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| `MEDSCALE_APP_EGRESS` | No remote application-originated request observed in the performed measurement. The MedScale host process held no non-loopback connection in any run. The WebView2 network stack (NetLog) carried only `http://tauri.localhost/*` (bundled assets via Tauri's custom protocol), `http://ipc.localhost/workspace_status` (IPC) and `wpad:80`. `wpad:80` is Windows proxy auto-discovery, a local-network probe made by the platform proxy resolver, not by MedScale code. CSP `connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost` and the navigation policy remain the application-level controls. |
| `EMBEDDED_PLATFORM_RUNTIME_EGRESS` | Observed in every run: one or two established TCP connections from the WebView2 **browser** process (no `--type`) to `2603:1046:c0b::/48` port 443 (Microsoft address space; no PTR record). They do **not** appear in NetLog, so they are made outside Chromium's URL-loading stack. They persist when SmartScreen is disabled. |

Attribution, from primary sources:
- wry 0.57.0 (used by Tauri 2.12) already starts WebView2 with `--disable-features=msWebOOUI,msPdfOOUI,msSmartScreenProtection` unless the app overrides browser arguments (`src/webview2/mod.rs`). SmartScreen URL reputation checks are therefore already off in MedScale, which matches the unchanged result of the SmartScreen-off run.
- Microsoft's [Data and privacy in WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/concepts/data-privacy) states that WebView2 collects diagnostic data through Chromium/Microsoft Edge telemetry, Windows data reporting and Watson crash infrastructure.
  - Optional data follows the Windows **Diagnostic data** setting.
  - Required data is collected "regardless of the Windows Diagnostic data setting".
  - Apps can control only SmartScreen and custom crash reporting.
- The observed connection is consistent with that runtime diagnostic or service channel. The exact service is **not proven**, because identifying the TLS server name needs a privileged packet capture, which was not performed.

Controls and decisions:
- **SmartScreen:** already disabled by Tauri's default browser arguments. No change.
- **Crash reporting:** wry does not set `IsCustomCrashReportingEnabled`, so WebView2 crash minidumps are sent to Microsoft by default. Minidumps can contain process memory. This is recorded as a private-data-readiness residual. Tauri does not expose this option, so changing it needs a separately reviewed environment-options change; it is not done here.
- **Diagnostic data:** governed by Windows. MedScale must not change OS diagnostic settings. An organization can manage it through Windows diagnostic-data policy. Blocking the endpoint could also interfere with WebView2 runtime servicing, and that was not tested.
- **Update channel:** WebView2 Runtime and Microsoft Edge share the Edge Update mechanism (separate updater processes, outside the MedScale process tree, not observed here). Enterprise policy can manage it.

What MedScale can truthfully state: the application's frontend and host make no remote requests (CSP, capabilities, navigation policy, and the observations above). What it cannot state: that the installed product produces no network traffic. The embedded Microsoft WebView2 runtime does, under Microsoft's terms and the user's or organization's Windows settings. F096-T05 remains **OPEN**.

### F096-T01 upgrade-path investigation (2026-10-07, PR #177)

Checked against crates.io at that date, with `cargo tree -i glib@0.18.5 --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` on the PR #177 lockfile:

- Path into the graph: `tauri 2.12.0` → `gtk 0.18.2` / `webkit2gtk 2.0.2` / `tao 0.37.1` / `muda 0.20.0` / `wry 0.57.0` → `glib 0.18.5` (plus `gio`, `pango`, `cairo-rs`, `soup3 0.5`, `javascriptcore-rs 1.1.2` from the same 0.18 family).
- Patched upstream exists only outside Tauri's pinned range: `gtk 0.19.0` (GTK3 bindings) depends on `glib ^0.22`, and `javascriptcore-rs 2.0.0` on `glib ^0.22`.
- No supported Tauri release adopts it:
  - `tauri 2.12.1` (latest stable) requires `gtk ^0.18`, `muda ^0.20`, `webkit2gtk ^2`.
  - `tauri-runtime-wry 2.12.1` requires `gtk ^0.18`, `webkit2gtk =2.0`, `wry ^0.57`, `tao ^0.37`.
  - `webkit2gtk 2.0.2` (latest), `wry 0.57.0` (latest), `tao 0.37.1` (latest), `muda 0.21.0` (latest) all require `gtk ^0.18`.
  - `tauri 3.0.0-alpha.4` still requires `gtk ^0.18` (adds `gtk4` alongside); it is a pre-release major migration and out of scope.
- A `[patch]` to `glib >= 0.20` is not API-compatible with the `gtk 0.18` family and would mean forking the whole GTK3/WebKitGTK binding stack under Tauri. That is an unsupported, out-of-scope migration and is not done.
- Reachability of `glib::VariantStrIter` from MedScale code is not claimed either way; MedScale code does not call it directly.

Result: F096-T01 stays OPEN and the `tauri dependency policy` (cargo-deny advisories) gate stays honestly FAILED. No advisory ignore is added (`deny.toml` keeps `ignore = []`). Re-check when a stable Tauri 2.x release moves `webkit2gtk`/`wry`/`tao`/`muda` to `gtk >= 0.19`.

The first 2.12 all-platform cargo-deny run reported advisories FAILED, licenses FAILED, bans/sources OK. A subsequent license-only check passed after exact-version admissions. The advisory finding remains a failing qualification gate. Duplicate-version warnings remain informational. The six canonical CI jobs and new native preview checks still need a final committed head.
